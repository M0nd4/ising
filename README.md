The compilation of the codes is done in each script that uses the corresponding codes.
The resulting data is saved in a folder inside ./dat/$outdir, being outdir the part of the project, i.e. ./dat/A3
At each bash script, the conditions of the simulations can be changed if you want.
Use ./ising -h for further information in how choose the input parameters.
